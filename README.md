## Higher Order Munchkins

The title of the repo is the best I could come up with.
Don't judge.

The purpose of this exercise is to build a project to help future students of all ages with their introduction to higher order functions.

The concept is fairly simple: The user will be presented with an initial array, and they must type into the textfieldl a way to operate on the contents of that array
using higher order functions.

The main function types listed here will be  forEach, map, filter, and reduce.

This program uses javascripts eval( ) method to read from the textfield and
then evaluate what the user typed in as actual code.

eval (  ) is evil.  You should never use it in production code, but it's great for educational programs, because it gives a lot of power to the user to write code that can actually be incorporated into the existing program.  For the sake of this tutorial, it will help you think about how to accept code snippets from a user that will actually do real work.
